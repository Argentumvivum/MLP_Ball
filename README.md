I've created this project using Unity3D. My motivation was to study about Machine Learning, after about 2 weeks of learning the essential math, and a week of reading about Multi Layer Perceptrons, this project came to life.

## How To Even...

In this section, I guide you through the process of setting up this project, so you can view it for yourself.

### Prerequisites

To open this project, it's required of you to have Unity3D installed.
* [Unity3D](https://store.unity.com/) ver. 2018.1.6f1 preferably, although it should work on a newer version.

In order to use Unity3D, you need to register your account with them.

### Installing

* Start off by downloading, and installing Unity3D from the link above.
* While Unity3D is installing, download the project by clicking the green "Clone or download" button, and select "Download Zip".
* Open up Unity3D when it's done installing, and log into your account.
* After that click on "Open" button, and navigate to where the "Machines gotta learn" folder is, select it, and click "Select folder" button to open project.

### Post Installation

After you're done with the installation process, if all you see under "Hierarchy" window is "Directional Light" and "Main Camera", don't panic. In the "Project" window, navigate to Assets > Scenes, and double click the "GameScene.unity". Now you should be able to just press the "Play" button, and play with the project in game window.
